# 👋🏼 Welcome to My GitHub!
 
This is where I build, learn and share my projects!
 
I'm currently a computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). Before switching into tech, I spent nearly three years working as an operations manager at Boston Micorgreens, where spreadsheets were the backbone of day-to-day operations. While building and maintaining those systems, I began to see both their strengths and limiations, but particularly how much more effective the business could be with purpose-built software. That experience fundamentally reshaped how I thought about operations and ultimately pushed me to transition into computer science.
 
🌱 Always happy to connect, collaborate, or discuss new ideas!
