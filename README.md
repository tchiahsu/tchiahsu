# üöÄ Welcome to My GitHub!

This is where I build, learn and share my projects!

I'm a first-year graduate student at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). Before diving into CS, I spent nearly 3 years as an Operations Manager at Boston Microgreens, where I saw first hand how critical technology is for the future of agriculture. In 2024, I made the decision to pivot into computer science to explore how technology can drive innovations in agriculture. While agricultural technology remains a strong interest of mine, I stay open to new ideas and opportunities to expand my knowledge in the broader tech landscape.

üå± I'm currently exploring backend systems, algorithms, and clean architecture! 

‚ú® When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me:
- Exploring new restaurants üçú
- Playing video games üéÆ
- Learning a new skill üß†

Always happy to connect, collaborate, or discuss new ideas!
