# 👋🏼 Welcome to My GitHub!
 
This is where I build, learn and share my projects!
 
I'm currently a computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). Before switching into tech, I spent nearly 3 years as an Operations Manager at a vertical farm, where I saw the impact that technology could have on the future of agriculture. In 2024, I pivoted into computer science to explore how technology can drive innovation. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in the tech field.
 
🌱 Always happy to connect, collaborate, or discuss new ideas!
