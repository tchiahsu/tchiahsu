# ðŸš€ Welcome to My GitHub!

This is where I build, learn and share my projects!

I'm currently a computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). Before switching into tech, I spent nearly 3 years as an Operations Manager at a vertical farm, where I saw the impact that technology could have on the future of agriculture. In 2024, I pivoted into computer science to explore how technology can drive innovation, I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in the tech field.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently exploring backend systems, algorithms, and clean architecture! 

âœ¨ When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me:
- Exploring new restaurants 
- Playing video games 
- Learning a new skill 

Always happy to connect, collaborate, or discuss new ideas!
